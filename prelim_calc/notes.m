# What quantity do we want to minimize?
# Time of run
# What speed to aim for?
# What parameters do we want?
# - We want required torque, rpm, etc
# - We want optimal wheel radius
# - Within limits of power supply

# What is limiting our runtime?
# - Mass
# - Power supply (Max current, voltage)
# - Normal force (max acceleration)

# What are limits to acceleration?
# - At most, we accelerate for half the distance (we need to slow down too)
# - minimize jerk?

# What is a good time?
# - sub 2
# 10 meters under 2 seconds
# 5 m/s minimum
# 10 m under 1 seconds
# 10 m/s minimum
